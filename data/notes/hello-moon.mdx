## test title h2

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.

### test title h3

If you need to use a one-off line-height value that doesn’t make sense to include in your theme, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value.

#### test title h4

If you need to use a one-off line-height value that doesn’t make sense to include in your theme, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value.

```scss
.token.property {
  color: #eee;
}

.token.class-name {
  color: #ffffb6;
  text-decoration: underline;
  content: "class";
}
```

```js
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const note: Note = allNotes.find((note: Note) => note.slug === params.slug);

  // deneme comment for testing
  if (!note) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/404",
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {
      note,
    },
  };
}
```
